# Corsair-Scimitar-Shared-CUE-Profiles

## Compatibility issue

[iCue 4 is not compatible anymore with the Scimitar mouse](https://help.corsair.com/hc/en-us/articles/360061456892-iCUE-is-not-detecting-certain-Corsair-devices). Use the [latest 3.x version you can find](https://www.corsair.com/ww/en/downloads)


A collection of keybind profiles for the Corsair Scimitar

I looked on the internet to find some ready profiles for my games but I couldn't find any, so here they are.
To use them you need a Corsair Scimitar mouse and the Corsair Utility Engine.
Open CUE, click on the mouse icon on the top right of the screen, click on the android-like setting button (the three horizontal lines on the top left of the screen) and choose Import/Export (the two arrows). Select your desired profile.
There's a description file for every game, to help your understand the keybindings and why I choose them.



## iCue crashes while importing

Corsair at a certain point broke its own software and never fixed it. If you have some old profiles from when iCue was still called Cue you may need to uncheck the first option in the second row of the importing settings screen (it should be something like "Lights Effect"). 

The old profiles are in the `cue` directory. They will be migrated in the `iCue` directory gradually.
