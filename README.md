# Corsair-Scimitar-Shared-CUE-Profiles
A collection of keybind profiles for the Corsair Scimitar

I looked on the internet to find some ready profiles for my games but I couldn't find any, so here they are.
To use them you need a Corsair Scimitar mouse and the Corsair Utility Engine.
Open CUE, click on the mouse icon on the top right of the screen, click on the android-like setting button (the three horizontal lines on the top left of the screen) and choose Import/Export (the two arrows). Select your desired profile.
There's a description file for every game, to help your understand the keybindings and why I choose them.
